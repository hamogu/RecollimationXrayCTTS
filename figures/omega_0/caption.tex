\label{fig:omega_0}
Four solutions to the ODE for four different starting points $\omega(z=0)=\omega_0$. The for panels show imporant variable for each solution. \emph{leftmost panel:} Profile of the external presure $P(z)$. \emph{middle left panel:} Position of the shock front. Note that the two axis in this panel are to scale, so that it is easy to appriciate that the innermost regions is much longer in $z$ direction (height above the disk) than it is wide. \emph{middle right panel:} Pre-shock velocity $v_0$ measured perperdicular to the shock font. \emph{rightmost panel:} Distribution of pre-shock temperatures, weighted by spherically integrated mass flux. In this case, this distribution is dominated by the temperature (which in turn is set by $v_0$) at very small heights, since the shock surface is close to the jet axis and thus this region covers a large solid angle of the stellar wind and therefore a large fraction of the total mass flux.
