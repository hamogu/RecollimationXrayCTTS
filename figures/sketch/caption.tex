Geometry in the $(z, \omega)$ plane. The $z$-axis is oriented along the jet, the $\omega$-axis in the plane of the circumstellar accretion disk. The innermost outflow layer is the unshocked stellar wind. The shock front is located at $R_{\rm{shock}}(z)$. The next layer is hot, post-shock stellar wind, which is separated from the disk wind by the contact discontinuity at $R_{\rm{contdisc}}(z)$.
