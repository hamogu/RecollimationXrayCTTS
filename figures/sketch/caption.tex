\label{fig:sketch}
Geometry in the $(z, \omega)$ plane. The $z$-axis is oriented along the jet, the $\omega$-axis in the plane of the circumstellar accretion disk. The innermost outflow layer is the unshocked stellar wind. The shock front is located at $R_{\rm{shock}}(z)$. The next layer is the hot, post-shock stellar wind, which is separated from the disk wind by the contact discontinuity at $R_{\rm{contdisc}}(z)$. The same geometry is employed in the paper by \citet{2012MNRAS.422.2282K} and we refer to that publication for a more detailed version of this figure.
