Solutions to the ODE for different pressure profiles. In the top row the scale height $h$ varies while all other parameters are fixed; the bottom row uses the same values for $h$, but also scales $P_0\propto h^{-1.5}$.
\emph{leftmost panel}: Profile of the external pressure $P(z)$. 
\emph{middle left panel}: Position of the shock front. Note that the two axes in this panel use the same scale. The unshocked stellar wind region is much longer in $z$ direction (height above the disk) than it is wide. 
\emph{middle right panel}: Pre-shock velocity $v_0$ measured perperdicular to the shock front. 
\emph{rightmost panel}: Distribution of post-shock temperatures, weighted by spherically integrated mass flux. This distribution is dominated by the temperature (which in turn is set by $v_0$) at small values of $z$, since the shock surface is close to the central object and covers a large solid angle of the stellar wind and therefore a large fraction of the total mass flux. Note that the histograms show the temperature directly behind the shock front and does not account for the fact that all plasma will eventually cool and contribute emission at cooler temperatures; a simulation of the thermodynamics of the cooling plasma is beyond the scope of this article.
