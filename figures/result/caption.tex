Different scenerios with parameters well within the range observed for CTTS predict a stellar wind shock that reaches 20-40~AU along the jet, but extends only few AU in the radial direction. For a description of the individual panels see Fig.~\ref{fig:p_ext}. The solid red histogram in the rightmost panel shows the post-shock temperature distribution for the fiducial model for $z>5$~AU, while the red solid lines shows the temperature distribution for all $z$ for the same model. All plasma with $T_{\mathrm{post-shock}}>1.5$~MK is found at $z>5$, but only a small fraction of the cooler plasma.
