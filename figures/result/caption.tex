Different scenerios with parameters well withing the range observed for CTTS predict a stellar wind shock that reaches 20-40~AU along the jet, but extends only few AU in the radial direction. For a description of the individual panels see Fig.~\ref{fig:p_ext}. The solid histogram in the rightmost panel shows results for the foducial model for $z>5$~AU. All plasma with $T_{\mathrm{post-shock}}>1.5$~MK is found in this region, but only a small fraction of the cooler plasma.
