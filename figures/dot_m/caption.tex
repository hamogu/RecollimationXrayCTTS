Solutions to the ODE for different mass loss rates. For a description of the individual panels see Fig.~\ref{fig:p_ext}. The middle left panel only shows the region close to the star for clarity. The shock front with the largest mass loss rate extends to $\omega=50$~AU at $z=60$~AU and comes back to the axis of symmetry at 130~AU.
