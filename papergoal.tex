\subsection{Models for high-energy emission from stellar jets}
\label{sect:intromodel}
In this article we explain how such a shock can be caused by the recollimation of the inner jet due to the shape of the boundary between stellar winds and disk winds similar to the work of \citet{2012MNRAS.422.2282K} for relativistic jets. This scenario naturally explains the stationary appearance and its location within the jet collimation region.
