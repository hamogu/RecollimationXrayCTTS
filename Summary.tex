\section{Summary}
\label{sect:summary}
A fast stellar wind that is confined by an external pressure from the disk wind will form a stationary collimation shock \citep{2012MNRAS.422.2282K}. We derive the geometrical shape and other properties of this shock front and find that the shock front closes back the axis of symetry and encloses a roughly egg-shaped volume for all combinations of parameters discussed in this article. This model provides a viable explanation of the soft X-ray and FUV emission observed at the base of young stellar jets, specifically in DG~Tau.
