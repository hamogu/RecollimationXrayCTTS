Emission from jet from pre-main-sequence stars is mostly observed in the optical and IR wavelength range. However, in several cases X-ray and UV observations reveal a weak but highly energetic component in those jets. If this component is heated in shocks then the required velocities are of the order 300~km~s$^{-1}$ for standing shocks and higher for moving shock fronts. In this article we show that a recollimation boundary layer between a fast stellar wind and a more massive disk wind would have the right properties to explain the observed X-ray emission in this scenario.
