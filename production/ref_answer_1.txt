We thank the referee for a thorough and timely report on our manuscript
entitled "Recollimation Boundary Layers as X-ray Sources in Young Stellar
Jets". We have taken all the referee's suggestions into account when we revised
our work. 



We have significantly expanded the article and reorganized several sections. In
particular we expanded the introduction to add a more thorough review of the
observational properties of jets from young stellar objects and to discuss
previous models in the literature in more detail to highlight where this work
contributes new results. We have also added a numerical fit of our
model to the X-ray spectrum of DG Tau and show fit results. We hope that this
makes it clear that our model is really "compatible" with the observed data.
While the numerical values we discuss are geared specifically to DG Tau, we
believe that our model might have a much broader relevance, but for stars other
than DG Tau this is a purely theoretical investigation because we are lacking
the required observations. In our opinion, this is still a worthwhile
proposition to discuss, and we have tried to separate this more clearly from
the discussion of DG Tau, which is based on direct observational data.
Last, we have changed numerous wordings and grammatical structures in an
attempt to make the article better understandable as suggested by the referee.


Unfortunately, that makes is not very practical to highlight all passages of
the article that have changed in bold font. If required, we can supply such a
version, but essentially the entire sections 1,4, 5, and 6  and large parts of
section 3 would appear bold.

We have reorganized the introduction of our manuscript and added a new
subsection where we review previous models in the literature and we point out
where our work expands on other models or supplements a previous analysis. We
hope that this clarifies the purpose of our calculations:

Our goal in this article is to see how well a recollimation shock of the
stellar wind can explain the X-ray observations from CTTs, specifically DG
Tau. Other models in the literature explain the X-rays by other mechanisms,
but they may not be the only possible explanation. It is important to study
every promising scenario in some detail to decide if it is compatible with
observations or not. In this work, we want to decide if a recollimation shock
is a viable model.

Additional references or remarks connecting our work to previously published
scenarios have been added at different points in the manuscript.

There are two very different regions where the magnetic field might play a role
in our model: As an outer boundary condition and in the stellar wind.

As an outer boundary for the stellar wind, we prescribe some external pressure
profile P(z). For our work it is unimportant which force provides this outer
boundary condition. We realize that the last version of the manuscript may have
caused the impression that this P(z) should be a thermodynamic pressure but in
fact any pressure is fine for our model. The external pressure might just as
well be supplied by an external magnetic field or by some combination of a
magnetic field and a thermodynamic pressure. We have added this statement to
the article. 
The article by Cabrit et al (2007) mentioned by the referee looks at some gas
flow and estimates an external pressure. The authors conclude that in their
case the external gas pressure is too low to explain the jet collimation. This
is an interesting result. However, Cabrit et al look at a different regime than
we discuss here. First, their PdBI observations deal with the jet about
500-1000 AU from the central source, which is at least an order of magnitude
larger than the size of the recollimation shock that we discuss in our
manuscript; second, they observe in molecular lines. If the jet still has an
onion like structure with several layers at those large scales (which might not
be the case) then the molecular gas should be an outer layer.
We describe a much smaller component, that is collimated by an outer layer of
optically emitting gas, which in turn is collimated by an outer layer of
molecular gas which (according to Cabrit at al) is collimated by a
magnetic field. 
Nevertheless, the results of Cabrit et al. serve as an interesting example how
the collimating force can actually be constrained.

The second region where we need to discuss magnetic fields is the stellar wind
that is INSIDE of the shock front. Here indeed we would have to treat magnetic
fields explicitly if they are important for the dynamics. Unfortunately, we
cannot follow the example of Koehler et al (2012b) in this case. In that
article the authors rely on asymptotic magnetic dominance and look for
self-similar solutions at large radii. In contrast, we analyze a shock front
that bends back towards the axis of symmetry within a few tens of AU. 

A simple numerical estimate (added to the paper) indicates that the ram
pressure in this region is higher than the magnetic pressure and thus it
dominates the dynamics, analogous to the situation in the solar wind, where the
pressure of the solar wind opens some of the field lines. 
While we agree that it would be very interesting to study the influence of a
magnetic field, the complex topologies generally observed in CTTS (see papers
by Donati et al and reconstruction by Jardine et al) are beyond what can be
done in the semi-analytical treatment that we present here.

DG Tau is the best case for such a study for two reasons:
1) There are more X-ray observations than for any other X-ray jet from a young 
   stellar object. DG Tau was observed in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2010 by Chandra
   and in 2004 and 2012 by XMM-Newton. The next best case is probably HH 154 
   with three Chandra and two XMM-Newton observations, but that source of HH
   154 is a binary, making the interpretation more complicated. All other YSO
   jet are observed only once or twice in X-rays.
2) In DG Tau we have the fortunate situation that the central star is absorbed,
   such that only the hard X-rays escape. Thus, we know for sure that the soft 
   X-rays seen close the central star must come from the inner jet. In all
   other cases the central region is either absorbed so that star AND jet are
   hidden (e.g. HH 2) or BOTH are visible (e.g. HD 163296) and since the star
   is much brighter than the inner jet, we cannot separate stellar soft
   component and inner jet emission.

In our extended and reorganized introduction we added a few sentences to
explain this. 
We believe that DG Tau really is a proto-type for X-ray emission from jets and
that all that we deduce in the article is equally applicable to jets from other
CTTS and HAeBes and most likely class I sources, too. It is just these
fortunate observational circumstances that make DG Tau special. Indeed, there
are indications for an equally stationary component in HH 154 and HD 163296; it
is not necessarily the jet physics, just the geometry of the absorption, that
makes is harder to analyze a stationary X-ray component in those sources, too.

Thus, while the observational evidence for stationary components in sources
other than DG Tau is weak, there also is no observational evidence to the
contrary. We see the X-ray spectrum at 30 AU from DG Tau. Should we not expect
that other CTTS have similar properties, even if we cannot observe them? We
realize that this is speculative, but if DG Tau is powered by a stellar wind
shock, there is no reason to believe that stellar wind shock might not occur in
other sources, too. 
We have extended the discussion on this point significantly and we hope that 
the revised version now addresses the referee's concerns. 


>>> It seems that the proposed scenario fits better for C IV than for X-rays.
>>> Therefore, maybe the structure and also the title of the manuscript could 
>>> be changed properly.

If even the stellar wind is too slow to explain the X-ray observations, then the
disk wind is certainly also too slow. In other word, if a recollimation shock
cannot explain the X-rays, then we need to invoke some other non-local
(scattering) or non-thermal (magnetic heating) model. It is the goal of this
article to see how far we can get with the recollimation model and to explain
the highest energies observed.
 
Although we did not give X-ray luminosities explicitly in the last version of
our manuscript we knew from a comparison with our work in Guenther et al (2009)
that the velocities and the mass flux of our fiducial model will produce a
significant amount of X-rays. The figures of the mass-fraction-per-bin
vs. T_postshock can be misleading in this regard - for mass losses of the order
10^-8 M_sun/yr only a very small fraction of the gas needs to be heated to 1.2
or 2 MK to emit enough X-rays (see Guenther et al 2009). We have added a new
section 4.3 that deals with this point.



>>> "luminosity and temperature": add values or range of values

The luminosity changes by about 1.6 (Schneider et al., in prep), the 25% we
quoted are for the temperature and we have now added the range of observed
temperatures to the sentence.

>>> "stationary nature...remained unexplained": different explanations have
>>> been proposed in the literature; please check and discuss previous models
>>> on the same topic

We wrote "remains unexplained in this scenario" with the intended meaning
"unexplained in the scenario of paper~I". We have changed
the wording of the paragraph to make it more obvious that we do not claim that
stationarity is unexplained in the literature (there are several scenarios by
different authors, some of which were pointed out by the referee), but just
that it is not explained in paper I.

>>> "we explain": a discussion on previous explanations should be added as well
>>>  as an explanation of the reason why in this case (proper just for DG Tau? 
>>> Valid also for other jets?) it is necessary to consider a different approach

In our restructured introduction we have added an entire subsection dedicated
to discuss previous models in the literature, their advantages and
disadvantages and how our analysis supplements and expands on those previous
models. 


>>> "strong shock": only stated here, but not explained why this approximation
>>> is valid in this case

We have added a new section that justifies the main assumption made in the
model (magnetic fields, sound speed, initial wind temperature).


>>> "Matsakos...in apparent contrast to Kompaneet's approximation": also 
>>> Kohler et al. 2012 relax this approximation; explain why this is not made 
>>> in this case or explore also this scenario

Kompaneet's approximation is clearly violated at large distances from the jet
axis since the pressure beyond the outer edge of the disk falls to the much lower 
values of the star forming cloud. In our model, we deal with much smaller
scales - scales so small that they all fall within the innermost resolution
element of the Matsakos et al simulations. We have use the word "apparent
contrast" here to highlight that this contrast is only "apparent" - the
simulations do not tell us if the approximation is violated at the relevant
scales. 

We have rewritten this paragraph to address the referee's concerns.

>>> "so narrow...resolution elements": how much narrow with respect to the 
>>> resolution?

We replaced this with "smaller than ... for the fiducial parameters". If we
vary the parameters we can also obtain solutions with a much larger radius, but
we know that those are excluded by observations anyway since we do not see an
hole filled with stellar wind within the disk wind.

>>> "typical densities...1.e6 cm-3": Podio et al. 2006 find lower values for 
>>> the jet densities, these are very high

Our model deals with the innermost component of the jet up to 50 AU from the
central star. In contrast, Podio et al. measure the density several hundred AUs from
the central source. Even for well collimated jets with small opening angles we
expect lower densities at such large distances.
We have added a discussion of these points in section 1.1.


>>> "60 AU": should it be 40 AU as in Fig. 3?

The figure is zoomed in to show the shape of shock front for smaller mass loss
rates. The maximal extend of the high mass-loss model is at 60 AU, although this
happens outside the figure (we mention this number in the text, because the
reader cannot see that him/herself in the figure).


>>> "Fortunately": is this result expected? Please explain if it is expected 
>>> or not

For small radii the ram pressure is high, so we expect a large dw/dz and it is
not surprising that we find this in the result. What we wanted to express using
the word "Fortunately" is that the choice of omega_0 has only a small influence
on the overall shape of the solution, which removes the need to do a detailed
parameter study for different omega_0. We have deleted the word "Fortunately"
from the sentence.


>>> "fiducial model": it should be described better the reason why the
>>> "fiducial" model is the best case

In this context, we use the term "fiducial" in the sense that this is our
"reference" model and we vary one parameter at the time from the
values of this model. The parameter values are chosen form what we expect to
find given the discussion in section 3 (e.g. the speed is taken to be just a
little higher than the highest observed speeds in the optical component where
we can measure them by Doppler shift). The "fiducial" model is not necessarily
the model that provides the best fit (and we show later that a model with
e.g. a higher velocity describes the X-ray spectrum from DG Tau better).


>>> "temperatures...sufficient...power the observed X-ray...": in Fig. 6 T is 
>>> lower than 2 MK, a value lower than observed in X-ray emitting jets

>>> "> 1 MK": but always < 2 MK which is lower than values typically derived 
>>> from the observations; just saying "< 1MK" is misleading and this is not 
>>> consistent with most X-ray emitting jets


We think there are three arguments why it is still worthwhile to explore this
temperature range:

1) The fiducial values are chosen as a "best-guess" of parameters based on
measurements of the optical velocity etc. We should explore what X-ray gas we
expect in  this case.

2) Soft X-rays are absorbed more than hard X-rays. If the astrophysical
source has a distribution of temperatures and some absorption, a fit with one
temperature component (which is the preferred method in the literature given
the low count numbers for stellar jets) tends to pick out a high
temperature. So, it is not surprising that the average temperature in our model
is lower than the fitted temperatures in the literature.

3) Very different temperatures are observed in different jets. In DG Tau (arguably
the best comparison for the model we discuss here) the temperature is a
little higher: Gudel 05,08 say 3.4 MK, but Guenther et al 09 show that there
is a strong degeneracy in the parameters space with the absorption and values
between 0.2-0.4 keV = 2-4 MK should be considered. 

In other objects, lower temperatures are routinely found:
- HH2: kT = 0.06-0.11 keV (around 1 MK) - Pravdo et al 2001 or Schneider et al
2012
- HH 80/81: 0.13+-0.05 keV (=1.5 MK) - Pravdo et al 2004
- Z CMa: 0.2 keV = 2 MK - Stelzer et al 2009
- RY Tau: 0.1-0.2 keV - see discussion in Skinner et al. 2011

Notice that HH 154 is significantly hotter close to the launching source: 0.6
keV = 6 MK (Schneider et al 2011 analyze the temperature vs. the distance from
the source).

We have argued above that most likely the emission seen in these other sources
is due to a different process, e.g. a termination shock or faster material in
the jet catching up with slower one downstream as in the simulations of Bonito. Yet, some
fraction of the cool material could also be due to a wind shock because the
wind shock and the first Herbig-Haro knot might blend together at the spatial
resolution of Chandra. The fact that we can reproduce those temperatures means
that this scenario is at least plausible. 


>>> "cannot be resolved": HST can resolve shocks in Halpha and [SII] with 
>>> resolution comparable to numerical models for near YSO jets; does the 
>>>authors mean in X-rays? Please clarify as this is not the case in general

HST is a spectacular instrument for resolving stellar jets and current IR
instruments with AO on the VLT or Gemini also reach fantastic resolutions of the
order 0.1". Yet, that is still insufficient to resolve the recollimation
shocks we predict here, although new observations are getting very close to
this limit and we are excited that this may provide a new test to verify or
falsify our model in the future.

The distance to the closest stellar jets (incl DG Tau) is about 140 pc. At that
distance 0.1" provides a resolution of 14 AU. The maximal radius of our
fiducial model is about 5 AU, the diameter is therefore 10 AU, comparable to
the resolution limit.
However, the contrast between a slightline that passes through the jet axis
(this slightline passes: disk wind - stellar wind - disk wind) and a slightline
that passes at omega = 5 AU (this sightline passes only through disk wind) is
expected to be small, because the layer of the disk wind (which is common to
both slightlines) is much thicker than the inner few AU of stellar wind.

Together with the fact that the current resolution limit is still larger
than the expected stellar wind zone in the center of the jet this means that we
cannot expect to resolve the inner hole in the disk wind that is created by a
small stellar wind zone such as predicted in our model.

We have added a footnote to give a short version of this argument in the paper.

Paper I explores the mass flux that would be required to explain the X-ray
emission with a shock. In the first version of our manuscript we tuned our
fiducial parameters to match those mass fluxes.
("Thus, it is fully consistent that our model predicts a mass loss fraction
larger than 10^−3 of the stellar wind at X-ray emitting temperatures."), so we
know from paper I that this reproduces the correct L_X. However, L_X is easy to
estimate from our solutions to the ODE, so we now give this number explicitly.

We have gone one step further and added a new section 4.5 where we perform
a numerical fit, that reproduces the observed Chandra spectrum from DG Tau and
the observed distance between the star and the soft emission at the same
time. The resulting fit is statistically acceptable and we added best-fit
values to table 1 and show a figure with the fitted spectrum. Given the
limitations of our model, especially the uncertainty in the external pressure
profile, other parameter values might also provide a good description of the
data (if a different pressure profile is chosen). In that sense the fit results
do not provide a unique description of DG Tau. However, they certainly show
that the model we suggest is compatible with the observed data.

The fitted model reproduces the X-ray spectra. As the referee suspected, the
best-fit value for the wind velocity is quite a bit higher than our fiducial
value (which is estimated based on the highest velocities observed at in proper
motion and red-shift in the optical and FUV), but they are compatible with the
speed of the fast solar wind. As stated above, our goal in this article is to
explain the hottest emission. Of course, we hope our model predicts the C IV
emission at the same time, but the simulation of a full position-velocity
diagram is beyond the scope of this semi-analytical work.

We have significantly expanded the introduction and the discussion section to
address these points. We discuss previous publications in more details now,
including those papers pointed out by the referee. 
We set out to test how well a recollimation shock can explain the observed
features of jets in general. We pick the example of DG Tau, which we consider
the best case for such a study (see above), but we have added significant
discussion about the applicability to other sources. In short, we can resolve
the X-ray spectrum of the component we need only in DG Tau. This does neither
prove nor disprove the existence of recollimation shocks as X-ray sources in
other jets, it is only a testimony to our limited observational
capabilities. We regard it as likely, that DG Tau is not a special case and
that other source might show similar phenomena, which (for different reasons)
are unobservable so far. However, the current data also allows the interpretation that
DG Tau is fundamentally different in some way from all other known young stars.

We believe that our work is complementary to other proposed models in the sense
that in this article we just explore one possibility to explain the X-ray
generation. The fact that our model is compatible with the observations does
not prove that it is right; other scenarios could also be compatible with the
observations. 
Some alternative scenarios have been discussed in detail (e.g. a
time-variable ejection speed in several papers by Raga et al and Bonito et
al.), while for others only a first-order estimate of the plausibility has been
published (e.g. Bally et al 03 estimate rough numbers for a scenario where the
resolved stellar X-ray emission is in fact scattered stellar emission, but
those estimates could be refined with numerical modeling). 
In this article, we simply explore one possible scenario that has not received
much attention in the literature before and we hope that in future articles (by
us or other groups) other scenarios will be studied to the same level of detail.
